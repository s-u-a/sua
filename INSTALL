---------------------
-- 1. Requirements --
---------------------

- Subversion client (http://subversion.tigris.org/)
- Webserver with HTTPS and PHP5 (including bzip2 and sqlite) support
- A Unix-like operating system


---------------------
-- 2. Installation --
---------------------

1. Get the newest version from the Subversion repository:
svn co svn://s-u-a.net/home/srv/svn/sua/trunk sua

2. If you have a C++ compiler available, first recompile db_things/create_galaxy. You will probably be using the GNU C++ compiler, so compile the program usign the following command:
g++ sua/db_things/create_galaxy.cpp -o sua/db_things/create_galaxy

3. Create a database, in for example:
sua/db_things/create_database sua/database1
Instead of sua/database1, you can choose any directory, which will be created. Make sure the database directory isn't accessable by the users, else anyone could try to crack passwords or get information about other users' accounts.
You will be asked for the desired admin username and password during the installation, see 3. Managing for more information.

4. To create more galaxies, run db_things/create_galaxy and pass the file name of the new galaxy in the universe/ database directory as parameter. Run the following to create galaxy 2:
sua/db_things/create_galaxy sua/database1/universe/2

5. Edit the file database.global/databases in your S-U-A installation directory (create it if it doesn't exist). The file containis information about the installed databases. The game can manage multiple databases (Â«universesÂ»), which the user can select one of at the login form. See database.global/databases.example for an example configuration.

6. If you want to configure a default hostname (for example to redirect all requests on http://www.example.org/ to http://example.org/) put that into the file database.global/hostname.

7. Check out some skins. Every directory you can see at http://websvn.dev.s-u-a.net/S-U-A-Extras/game-skins/?rev=0&sc=0 is a skin pack. To install the default skin pack for example, check it out from the login/style/ directory of your game installation:
svn co svn://s-u-a.net/home/srv/svn/sua-extras/game-skins/default

8. Start the event handler for fleet actions. Just execute db_things/eventhandler. When using the -d option, the event handler will fork itself and run in background then.


-------------------------
-- 3. Special settings --
-------------------------

- If you want to disable the noob protection for a certain database, just create a file `nonoobs' to the database directory.
- To create more galaxies, change to universe/ in the database directory and run ./create_galaxy as many times as you wish.
- To change building times or to create your own items, remove the symlinks from items/ in your database directory and copy their targets there (the files `gebaeude', `forschung', `roboter', `schiffe', `verteidigung' from the database.global/ game directory). Then you can change them without affecting other databases.
- To configure instant messaging notifications, edit the file database.global/messengers. You find an example in database.global/messengers.example. Please mind that you have at least to define a Jabber account. Supported protocols until now: jabber, aim, icq, msn, yahoo. Only jabber and icq seem to work properly.
- You can configure global factors for production, costs and time. Just enter numbers into the database files global_prod_factor, global_cost_factor, and global_time_factor.


-----------------
-- 4. Managing --
-----------------

You were asked for the desired admin username and password during the installation, the admin area is accessable in the directory admin/ of your S-U-A installation. Access it via HTTPS, just enter your admin username and password there.


-------------------------
-- 5. Problems or bugs --
-------------------------

S-U-A's bugtracker is reachable under https://bugs.s-u-a.net/. The bugtracker is in German, you can also post in English there.
Go to irc://irc.gamesurge.net/sua-dev if you have questions or installation problems.

If you get an 500 Internal Server Error with your game installation, check if S-U-A's directory has at least permission to
AllowOverride Limit FileInfo Options
Else modify the .htaccess files, but this may affect the functionality of the game.
