---------------------
-- 1. Requirements --
---------------------

- Subversion client (http://subversion.tigris.org/)
- Webserver with HTTPS and PHP5 (including bzip2 and sqlite) support
- A Unix-like operating system


---------------------
-- 2. Installation --
---------------------

1. Get the newest version from the Subversion repository:
svn co svn://s-u-a.net/home/srv/svn/sua/trunk

2. Create a database, in for example:
sua/db_things/create_database sua/database1
Instead of sua/database1, you can choose any directory, which will be created. Make sure the database directory isn't accessable by the users, else anyone could try to crack passwords or get information about other users' accounts.
You will be asked for the desired admin username and password during the installation, see 3. Managing for more information.

3. To create more galaxies, run ./create_galaxy from you universe/ database directory.

4. Edit the file database.global/databases in your S-U-A installation directory (create it if it doesn't exist). Put the hostname where the game will be reachable into the first line. (It doesn't matter in which directory from the server root the game is installed.)
The following lines will contain information about the installed databases. The game can manage multiple databases (Â«universesÂ»), which the user can select one of at the login form. Each following line represents a database:
(Database ID, must be unique) [Tab] (Database directory, you can specify this relatively from you S-U-A installation directory) [Tab] (Database name, will be shown in the select box at the login form) [Tab] (Hostname to where the game will redirect users that select this database. By this you can run an own host / virtual host for each database.)
I propose you already noticed that you can access an example for this file under http://s-u-a.net/database.global/databases.

5. Check out some skins. Every directory you can see at http://websvn.dev.s-u-a.net/S-U-A-Extras/game-skins/?rev=0&sc=0 is a skin pack. To install the default skin pack for example, check it out from the login/style/ directory of your game installation:
svn co svn://s-u-a.net/home/srv/svn/sua-extras/game-skins/default

6. Start the event handler for fleet actions. Just execute db_things/eventhandler with the database directory for which it should run as first parameter. You can use a relative path as database directory, always seen from the game directory. The event handler will fork itself and run in background then.


-------------------------
-- 3. Special settings --
-------------------------

- If you want to disable the noob protection for a certain database, just create a file `nonoobs' to the database directory.
- To create more galaxies, change to universe/ in the database directory and run ./create_galaxy as many times as you wish.
- To change building times or to create your own items, remove the symlinks from items/ in your database directory and copy their targets there (the files `gebaeude', `forschung', `roboter', `schiffe', `verteidigung' from the database.global/ game directory). Then you can change them without affecting other databases.
- To configure instant messaging notifications, edit the file database.global/messengers. You find an example in database.global/messengers.example. Please mind that you have at least to define a Jabber account. Supported protocols until now: jabber, aim, icq, msn, yahoo. Only jabber and icq seem to work properly.
- You can configure global factors for production, costs and time. Just enter numbers into the database files global_prod_factor, global_cost_factor, and global_time_factor.


-----------------
-- 4. Managing --
-----------------

You were asked for the desired admin username and password during the installation, the admin area is accessable in the directory admin/ of your S-U-A installation. Access it via HTTPS, just enter your admin username and password there.


-------------------------
-- 5. Problems or bugs --
-------------------------

S-U-A's bugtracker is reachable under https://bugs.s-u-a.net/. The bugtracker is in German, you can also post in English there.
Go to irc://irc.gamesurge.net/sua-dev if you have questions or installation problems.

If you get an 500 Internal Server Error with your game installation, check if S-U-A's directory has at least permission to
AllowOverride Limit FileInfo Options
Else modify the .htaccess files, but this may affect the functionality of the game.
