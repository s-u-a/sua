Youâ€™re welcome to commit patches and fixes using the bugtracker on https://bugs.s-u-a.net/

Please mind the following rules about the used coding style:

- Indent by using one tab.
- Use htmlspecialchars() for any HTML/XML output, even if it never happens that the string contains <>"&.
- Use urlencode() for any URL parameter, even if it contains only a number (so use htmlspecialchars(urlencode()) for HTML/XML URLs)
- Remember to append htmlspecialchars(urlencode(session_name()).'='.urlencode(session_id())) to keep the user logged in.
- Write your code so that you get no messages with error_reporting(2047), use @ only if there really is no other way.

Additional information will follow.
